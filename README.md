# TryCrackMeChallenge
This is a challenge in which you will attempt to crack a C++ login system without editing or messing with the source code... You can view the source code and do what you like
but if you actually want to make the challenge a challenge then it's recommended you do not edit the source code and play by the rules

# Enjoy!

Please wait it's coming soon!
