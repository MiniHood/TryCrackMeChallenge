# TryCrackMeChallenge
This is a challenge in which you will attempt to crack a C++ login system without editing or messing with the source code... You can view the source code and do what you like
but if you actually want to make the challenge a challenge then it's recommended you do not edit the source code and play by the rules

# Whats the difference between easy and hard?
The easy version has no string obfuscation and has next to no protection but the hard one has debugger protection, string obfuscation and a couple more features.

# Enjoy!

Please wait coming soon!
